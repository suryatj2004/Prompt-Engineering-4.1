# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 2 with Comparative Analysis Prompt, Comparative Analysis Prompt and Prompt Size Limitations
## Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

## Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.


# Scenario Prompt:
"A customer has purchased a smart thermostat and is having trouble setting it up. They contact the chatbot for assistance. The customer says: 'I’ve just received my smart thermostat, but I’m not sure how to install it. Can you help me set it up?'

### 1.Prompt Type: Experiential Perspective Prompt
Prompt:

“From the perspective of a technical support agent, how would you assist a customer in setting up a smart thermostat?”

Expected Output:

“Of course! First, let's ensure your thermostat is properly connected to your Wi-Fi network. Please locate the mounting bracket and connect the wires as per the manual. Once that’s done, turn on the device and follow the on-screen instructions to pair it with the app on your phone. After you’re connected, I’ll guide you through the temperature settings and customization options. If you encounter any issues along the way, don’t hesitate to ask, and I’ll be happy to assist!”

Scenario Prompt:

"A customer is tracking an order they placed for a laptop but has encountered an issue where the tracking page does not show any updates. The customer says: 'I’ve been checking the tracking status for my laptop order, but it hasn’t updated in days. Can you check the status for me?'

### 2.Prompt Type: Comparative Analysis Prompt
Prompt:

“Compare how a rule-based chatbot and a machine-learning model would respond to this customer inquiry about an order status update.”

Expected Output:

“A rule-based chatbot might provide a fixed response such as: ‘Please allow up to 72 hours for shipping updates. For further assistance, contact customer service.’ It is efficient but may not fully address the customer’s concerns. A machine-learning chatbot, however, would likely respond with something like: ‘I understand your frustration. I’ve checked your order status and see that the carrier hasn’t updated the tracking yet. Sometimes delays happen in the system. I’ve escalated this issue to the delivery team, and you’ll receive an update within 24 hours. Thank you for your patience.’ This is more personalized, showing empathy and taking proactive action.”

Scenario Prompt:

"A customer has a general inquiry: 'How do I contact customer support if I need help with my order?'

### 3.Prompt Type: Prompt Size Limitations
Prompt:

“Generate a response in under 150 tokens to a customer asking how they can contact customer support for help with their order.”

Expected Output:

“You can contact customer support anytime by visiting our ‘Contact Us’ page. You can reach us via email, phone, or live chat. If your inquiry is order-related, make sure to have your order number ready for quicker assistance. We’re here to help 24/7!”

| **Experiential Perspective Prompt** | Provides a more subjective or empathetic response based on experience | Troubleshooting, personalized support           | Builds empathy, helps create a more conversational tone, adds personalization to responses. |
| **Comparative Analysis Prompt**   | Encourages a comparison between two or more entities to highlight differences | Order status, product feature comparisons, issue resolution | Provides a deeper understanding of options, contrasts and informs decisions effectively. |
| **Prompt Size Limitations**       | Generates concise responses while respecting character/word limits | Short inquiries, quick answers, FAQs           | Ensures clarity and brevity, ideal for time-sensitive or constrained environments. |

# Result:
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
